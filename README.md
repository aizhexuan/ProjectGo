# ProjectGo
Go Projects from learning Go language

## Reason for this Repo
I am consolidating all projects worked on while developing an understanding of the Go Language. I'm doing this to separate projects that I do for work/for my self from projects that I do for the purposes of study.

## How to use this Repo
I will list the location of courses first, then have folders for each individual course in the location. 
Example: LinkedIn will have a folder for each of the LinkedIn Learning Courses.
